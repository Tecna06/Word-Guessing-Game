# Word Guessing Game 🎯

A simple Python project  to help beginners understand basic code structure, and code flow... 

## 🧠 Project Goal

The goal of the game is to guess a hidden word letter by letter. You only have a limited number of attempts, so guess wisely!

## 💡 Code Flow

At the top of a Python file, we usually write:
1. Imports and modules  
2. Database connections (if needed)  
3. Constant variables  
Then comes the main logic of the program.

This project follows that basic structure to help learners understand the flow of a typical Python script.

## ✅ Features

- Hidden word to guess
- Limited number of guesses
- Tracks correct guesses
- Shows progress with underscores and revealed letters

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Save the file as `word_guessing_game.py`
3. Run it in your terminal:
